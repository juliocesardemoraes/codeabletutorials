FOR THIS TO WORK YOU HAVE TO USE AN API KEY FROM TMDB MOVIE DATABASE
https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api

LOGIN AND GET YOUR API KEY, Then replace it inside your index.js file,
in the <YOURAPIKEYHERE> position

THIS REPO IS for all my coding classes on youtube.
I will structure it using branches.

For example the hamburguer tutorial, will have a branch called hamburguer

And you can check it out just by selecting it right here:
